An automated trading strategy linking the Myfxbook community outlook to the Oanda API.  

This is a long term sentiment based mean reversion trading algorithm.  It is designed for use with low leverage as it doesn't use stop losses.

Use of this code is entirely at your own risk and I will not be held liable for any losses incurred.

Note: The code should be modified to handle errors correctly.
